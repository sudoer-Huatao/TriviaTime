# TriviaTime

 ~ Learn a new fun fact or trivia as a notification everyday. ~

## How it works

<img width="200" height="200" alt="1024x1024" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fcef98d-7833-42cf-97c0-556d2ede0cca" />

When you open TriviaTime, a notification is sent containing a trivia question and answers (all questions and answers are from the OpenTrivia database API).
If you get a message about Apple refusing to open this app, **go to System Settings>General>Login Items and Extensions and add TriviaTime as a login item**. It is highly recommended to do so.

Also make sure to allow notifications for the TriviaTime app - **otherwise the app will not function properly**.

## Installation

Download the .dmg file, open it, and drag the app into the Applications folder.

> Unfortunately, I don't have an Apple Developer account yet, so when it is opened, Apple will show that it is from an unidentified developer.
> 1. Click **OK** to close the popup.
> 2. Open **System Settings**>**Privacy & Security**.
> 3. Scroll down and click **Open Anyway** next to the warning about TriviaTime.
> 4. Confirm with your password if prompted.
> You only need to do this **once**.

## How to download

Download directly from GitHub Releases.
